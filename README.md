# Hi, I'm Sébastien 👋

**API Integration Developer and API Customer Support**

3 years debugging API integrations at Sellsy (3000+ issues resolved, 15 tickets/day, 98% customer satisfaction).
Three years spent supporting API integrations at Sellsy have taught me one thing: most integration failures are predictable, optimizable, and avoidable.
I am now ready to move from debugging other people's integrations to creating my own.
I develop API integrations and connectors, and I share what I learn.

## 🔧 What I Do

- **API Integration**: REST APIs, OAuth, Webhooks
- **Languages**: Elixir, Node.js, Python, JavaScript
- **Tools**: Postman, Make, n8n,ActivePieces, Git, Docker

## 💼 Professional Experience

**API Technical Support** (2023 - Present)
- Support developers integrating with Sellsy API (15+ tickets/day, 3000+/year)
- Average staff satisfaction rate: 98% customer satisfaction
- Chift connector support (accounting tools connection)
- Key accomplishments: Identification and documentation of undocumented API V1 models. Contribution to more comprehensive and clearer FAQs. 20% reduction in recurring issues thanks to improved documentation and time savings in customer responses, e.g., the FAQ explaining how to make a V1 call using OAuth V2 is the most frequently used.

**Software Developer** (Feb 2022 - 2023)
- Backend/Frontend debugging (PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, XSL)
- Feature development (frontend)
- Legacy code maintenance and refactoring
- Developer integration import platform flatfile
